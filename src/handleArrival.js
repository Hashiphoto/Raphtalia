 * Function called when a new member is added to the guild. First, it checks their papers. If they do not have a papers entry,
 * it creates a new one and sends a greeting. Second, it gives them the immigrant role. Third, it checks if they need a nickname and
 * allows them to assign a new one. Fourth, it asks them to recite a pledge (unless they have already given the pledge).
 * If they do, they are made a comrade. If they don't, they are softkicked
