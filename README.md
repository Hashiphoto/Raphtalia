# Raphtalia Bot
A discord bot to assist with managing the Gulag. Still in development right now, but the planned features are as follows:
1. Kick members
2. Count infractions
3. Detect pro-capitalist or pro-democracy language
4. Play the soviet national anthem on a voice channel
5. Post the communist manifesto

# Contributing
1. Fork the repositry
2. Clone it onto your machine
3. Run the command 'npm install' or 'npm ci'
4. Make changes
5. Create a pull request

At this time, I don't have a way for contributors to test their code because I don't want to give out the Discord bot's token, and the MySQL database is only running on my machine.
